 Description: Header file for command interpreter.


 Author:      D. Calvet,        calvet@hep.saclay.cea.fr
              

 History:
  May 2011: created

  February 2014: (version 1.2) Changed firmware to reset SCA write pointer
  for each event.

  February 2014: (version 1.3) Changed firmware of pulser to support the use
  of the pulser with/without also generating a trigger

  February 2014: (version 1.4) Changed multiplicity trigger firmware

  March 2014: (version 1.5) Fixed bug in "aget x mode" and "aget x test"
  commands

  March 2014: (version 1.6) added command "aget x indyn_range"

  March 2014: (version 2.0) migrated from ISE 13.1 on Windows XP 32 bit
  to ISE 14.1 on Windows 8.1 64 bit
  updated Ethernet core from 2.01a to 3.01a and AXI DMA from version 3.00a to
  5.00a.

  March 2014: (version 2.1) made POLARITY programmable for each ASIC
  independently. CmdiContext member polarity is non a vector instead of a
  scalar.

  March 2014: (version 2.2) Firmware changes:
  - Zero-suppressor now ignores the 4 last time-bins when comparing to threshold
  - Added TCM_IGNORE to be able to exclude a Feminos from the system
  - Changed dead-time measurement: now includes only the dead-time of the
  Feminos and no longer global system dead-time.

  March 2014: (version 2.3) added command "aget x icsa"

  March 2014: (version 2.4) added command "aget x cur_ra" and "aget x cur_buf"

  June 2014: (version 2.5) changed minibios to add FEC power state after boot
  Added command "tstamp_isset", "tstamp_isset clr", "snd_mult_ena"

  June 2014: (version 2.6) increased the number of status/configuration registers
  from 8 to 10. Remapped time_probe to a different bit and register,
  added commands "mult_limit" and "tcm_bert". The corresponding logic was added
  in the firmware.

  June 2014: (version 2.7) added command "erase_hit_ena" and "erase_hit_thr"
  Changed firmware to support these new functions.
